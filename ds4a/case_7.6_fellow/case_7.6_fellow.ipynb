However, more advanced study of the data science arena (such as with hypothesis testing & inference, predictive modeling, and machine learning) often requires some *theoretical* background as well, where we work with abstractions of the truth that aren't completely bound by the data we have.

    "Often times, it is important too have a single measure of the variability of a feature instead of having to always look at its histogram. An important measure of variability we will be using in this case is **standard deviation**. It possesses important mathematical properties that make it useful for tasks beyond simple descriptive statistics. The formula for the standard deviation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down. First, the Greek letter $\\sigma$ (lowercase *sigma*) is the conventional way to represent the standard deviation in mathematical formulas. It is equal to the square root of this term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What this term is doing might seem complicated, but it's not so bad. You first take each value in your dataset (that's $x_i$) and subtract the mean $\\mu$ from it. For instance, if the mean is 5 and $x_i$ is 11, then you have to subtract 5 from 11. You then raise the resulting number to the second power and repeat the process for all the numbers in your dataset. Then, you sum up all these values (that's what the Greek letter $\\Sigma$, uppercase *sigma*, means) and divide the sum by $N$, which is the number of elements in the dataset (we do this to make this quantity into an average).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why $(x_i-\\mu)$ is raised to the second power is because for values of $x_i$ that are less than the mean, this value is negative, so when you sum across all of these values, the negative values would cancel out the positive ones and give us zero! You can therefore think of the standard deviation as the average deviation from the mean to any point in the dataset, either to the left or to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the square root of the whole thing to bring it back to the same units that our dataset uses. For instance, if you have a dataset of people's heights, it makes little sense to have an average deviation in square feet or square meters, so you need to take the square root to have it in feet or meters."

However, we often have to be forward-looking and also predict the likelihood of future events, which is more *theoretical* in nature. We had a sampling of this in previous Exercises, but here we will talk more in detail about distributions and some of the basic theory around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were to plot the distribution of BMIs for the smokers in our dataset — that would give us a histogram. But a histogram is entirely based on a limited sample of past data, and doesn't allow us to directly make predictions about the general smoker population, *independent of our specific dataset*. To do this, we need a **probability density function (PDF)**, which is a theoretical construct that helps us compute the probability of where any randomly chosen smoker's BMI would fall, and which is not strictly beholden to the limits of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we didn't say that the PDF can directly tell us the probability that a randomly chosen smoker's BMI would be exactly some given value; say, 30. The reason for this is because BMI is a **continuous** value rather than a **discrete** value; it can take on any decimal value, so the probability that a person's BMI is *exactly* 30 is pretty much zero. It's virtually guaranteed that what we think is a 30 BMI is actually a 29.99 BMI, or a 30.01 BMI, or even a 30.001 BMI. Either way, finding a person with a BMI of exactly 30 is like trying to find a unicorn."

    "3. The probability density function is what allows us to move from the fully empirical world of histograms, which are an imperfect and limited representation of the entire population, to modeling and inferring characteristics of that population. The area under the PDF and above 0 between two specific $x$-values $a$ and $b$ gives the probability that a randomly chosen sample from that population will have an $x$-value for that variable between $a$ and $b$.\n",
