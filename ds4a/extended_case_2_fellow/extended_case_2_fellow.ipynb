    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** While natural *events* often cannot be avoided, the risks they present can be managed, either by mitigation, avoidance, or insurance, in order to prevent them from becoming natural *disasters*. The consultancy firm you work for has been hired by an independent advocacy group that wants to conduct an analysis of the US emergency management system of preparedness, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery, with the purpose of proposing legislative reforms to make it more effective and financially efficient. Their ultimate goal is to help increase the government's ability to prevent disasters from happening and reduce the negative impact of those that cannot be completely avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your client would like to know which storm event types are more likely to become disasters, and in which locations, as measured by the number of deaths, injuries, and economic damage they cause. Additionally, they would like to conduct a preliminary assessment of whether the [Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/3721) had any impact on the severity of the disasters that occurred after the bill was signed. This Act centralized the US emergency management under the coordination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a response to the enormous human and material losses that were caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You have been provided with a compressed GZIP file of storm events from 1970 to 2020 as recorded by the US [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). You can check the [documentation](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/Storm-Data-Bulk-csv-Format.pdf) for more information."

    "7. **CZ_TIMEZONE**: The timezone of the place where the event occurred\n",
    "8. **END_DATE_TIME**: The date and time when the event ended. Times and dates are in LST (Local Solar Time), which means that they reflect the local time, not a coordinated time\n",
    "9. **TOR_F_SCALE**: The [enhanced Fujita scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale) (highest recorded value). This scale measures the strength of a tornado based on the amount of damage that it caused. A level of `EF0` means \"light damage\" (wind speeds of 40 - 72 mph), and a level of `EF5` means \"incredible damage\" (261 - 318 mph). `EFU` means \"Unknown\"\n",

These dollars are \"real\" dollars, which means that the damages for all the years have been converted ([deflated](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~rnau/Decision411_2007/411infla.htm)) to the value they would have had in 1982-84. This was done to make the damages comparable across years, since dollars [change purchasing power every year](https://www.insider.com/fast-food-burgers-cost-every-year-2018-9) due to inflation. The deflation was done using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Urban Consumer Price Index, whose base period is 1982-84."
